The `parser` R package.
=======================

Introduction
------------

The `parser` package is an alternative implementation of the base R parser.
The expressions returned are the same but the information is presented slightly
different from the base parser.

The parser package was originally written by Romain Francois, but is now being
maintained by Andrew Redd.  The source code is based off the 
[GNU bison](http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) parser project.

Reporting Bugs
--------------
The github [issues tracker](https://github.com/halpo/parser/issues) will
be used to request bug fixes and feature requests.  The github fork/pull 
system will also be used for any submitting fixes.
